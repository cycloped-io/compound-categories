# Processing of Wikipedia compound cateogires

These scripts are used to extract data from compound Wikipedia categories such
as 'People born in the United States'. The basic idea is to automatically build
patterns of the category names and then extract the relevant data by examining
these patterns, e.g. 'People born in X'.
